# Electricity-Grid-Classification
This document reports the analysis of local stability electric grid dataset, hosted by UCI Machine learning repository. 
The data set contains readings from an electrical system having 4 nodes producing electricity and using the data to 
determine the system stability.  *Projectâ€™s Goal**: Goal is to model the data, so as to accurately predict the stability of electric grid.
Also, infer the relationship between predictors and the response.The URL of the dataset is https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Electrical+Grid+Stability+Simulated+Data+. 
The scope of this project is to apply machine learning concepts on a desire data set. I used R language through out the project.
